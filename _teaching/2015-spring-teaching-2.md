<h3>Course Description</h3>
Introduce students to the basic abstractions from Discrete Mathematics that are of central relevance in Computer Science. Teach students to reason formally using these abstractions, and to recognize and apply them in various areas of Computer Science and Software Engineering. Prepare students for courses on the foundations of computation.

<h3>Course Learning Outcomes</h3>
Upon successful completion of the course students will have basic knowledge and skills in mathematical and formal reasoning. In particular, students will be able to
<ul>
    <li>apply propositional logic, truth tables, logical inference, predicate logic and quantifcation as tools to describe formal objects and their properties<li>
    <li>use proof techniques, inductive proofs and recursive denitions to reason about formal objects<li>
    <li>understand the concepts and properties of sets, functions and relations, and use them to describe discrete objects<li>
<ul>
