An introduction to pattern classification and structural pattern recognition. Topics include: feature extraction, Bayesian decision theory, nearest-neighbor rules, clustering, support vector machines, neural networks, classifier combination, and syntactic pattern recognition techniques such as stochastic context-free grammars. The course is part lecture and part seminar: students will present some course material to the class as well as complete and present a research paper. In addition, programming assignments will provide students with practical experience in constructing pattern recognition systems such as optical character recognizers (OCR).
